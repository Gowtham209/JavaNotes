/*
 * Anonymous Class
 * Anonymous Class needs a BASE CLASS first with Methods because Anonymous Class works by 
 OVERRRIDING the Method that is Present the BASE CLASS
 * Anonymous Class means Creating a CLASS itself without a CLASS NAME while Creating 
 a Object.This Object can only have the ACCESS to that ANONYMOUS CLASS Methods
 * No new Object can ACCESS the Anonymous Class Methods.If Anonymous Class Methods are
needed to that Object then MUST retype the ENTIRE ANONYMOUS CLASS with Methods itself 
this won't be a EFFICIENT method .For this kind of Problem creating a New class itself will be BEST
