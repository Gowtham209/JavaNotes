FROM Non-Static methods we have 'direct' access to both Static and Non-Static Fields & Methods using Direct Static Method and Variable Name or with 'this' or Class Name
BUT
FROM Static methods we CAN'T ACCESS Non-Static Methods and Fields Because Non_static Fields & Methods Belongs to Instance NOT WITH CLASS ITSELF and If Needed to Access then a Temprory Object Needed to be Created
